    <h2>position: static;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is
    always positioned according to the normal flow of the page:</p>

    <div class="static">
    This div element has position: static;
    </div>

    <body>

    <h2>position: relative;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>

    <div class="relative">
    This div element has position: relative;
    </div>

    <h2>position: fixed;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same place even if the page is scrolled:</p>

    <div class="fixed">
    This div element has position: fixed;
    </div>

    <h2>position: absolute;</h2>

    <p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed):</p>

    <div class="relative">This div element has position: relative;
      <div class="absolute">This div element has position: absolute;</div>
    </div>

    <h1>This is a heading</h1>
    <img src="emoji-eye.jpg" width="100" height="140">
    <p>Because the image has a z-index of -1, it will be placed behind the text.</p>
